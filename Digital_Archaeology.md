# Digital Archaeology 

"Digital archaeology should exist to assist us in the performance of archaeology as a whole. It should not be a secret knowledge, nor a distinct school of thought, but rather simply seen as archaeology done well, using all of the tools available to and in better recovering, understanding and presenting the past. In the end, there is no such thing as digital archaeology. What exists, or at least what should exist, are intelligent and practical ways of applying the use of computers to archaeology that better enable us to pursue both our theoretical questions and our methodological applications. (T. L. Evans, Daly, and MyiLibrary 2006)"

The centrality of computing to archaeological reconstructions of past societies cannot be understated. A modern researcher now has at his or her fingertips a plethora of digital tools, techniques and methodologies from which to draw, which are creatively adapted to the task at hand despite, in many cases, their original intentions being related to computer science or video gaming. A modern archaeologist thus sits at a juncture in computing few other diciplines can claim to occupy, with architectural design, GIS, archaeocomputing, VR and 3D design just some of the possible avenues open for exploitation.
